# snippets
This project is intended as an archive of my work as a front-end developer at the Univeristy of Oxford. Only snippets of the elements I made and want to preserve displayed as web pages.

Random num:
  * The goal was to generate a random number once for the users.
  * The design is meant to emulate an elevator button with the light turning on when reaching the floor.
  * A quick randomiser animation was added for a more engaging experience.

Blurred text:
  * Here the users were to read a short story with only a small section actually legible, the rest blurred.
  * Instead of inserting an image the text itself was styled in a way that it wasn't possible to read it directly.
  * For screen readers aria attributes were added so that they read a distorted noise.
