# snippets
This project is intended as an archive of my work as a front-end developer at the Univeristy of Oxford. Only snippets of the elements I made and want to preserve displayed as web pages.

Random num:
  * The goal was to generate a random number once for the users.
  * The design is meant to emulate an elevator button with the light turning on when reaching the floor.
  * A quick randomiser animation was added for a more engaging experience.

Blurred text:
  * Here the users were to read a short story with only a small section actually legible, the rest blurred.
  * Instead of inserting an image the text itself was styled in a way that it wasn't possible to read it directly.
  * For screen readers aria attributes were added so that they read a distorted noise.

Animation:
 * Users interact with "Click me" text to start an animation.
 * A static image switches to an animated gif.
 * The gif was created based on a photograph in Photoshop.
 * While the animation is my work, the photograph is not mine.

Character quiz:
 * The users create a character by answering the questions in this character questionnaire.
 * Each question is on a card and progress is not permitted until an answer is chosen.
 * After the last question all of the answers are displayed.

Form and graph:
 * Three form inputs are to be populated with some text. In the original context it was three different objects.
 * After submitting the answers three graphs appear with the text from the form as labels.
 * The graphs are inline svg objects.

Table styles 1:
 * Collection of table designs that are not yet implemented in the courses.
 * As these are not yet used they are subject to further iteration.

Table styles 2:
 * Continuation of the table styles concept.
 * These are actually in use and are considered more advanced designs.

API:
* This file is a demo of working with APIs - http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/ and https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
* The users see an interface with 3 different waveforms for 3 different audio files.
* In the original context they are asked to place markers when they think a criteria has been met in the audio.
* After they are finished they are asked to take a screenshot and upload it to a forum.
* To ensure that the screenshots match in appearance and are easy to compare to each other I built in a way to take the screenshots in browser only of the neccessary area.

Typewriter quiz:
* Multi-level quiz with section seperated into "Sequences". Originally the purpose of this was to let the users generate a film script based on the choices they made.
* The typewriter motif is for strengthening the idea of the result being a script the users create.
* There is an option for navigating back to the answered sections of the form where users can review but not change their answers.
